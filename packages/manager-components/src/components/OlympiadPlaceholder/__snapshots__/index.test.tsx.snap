      The Melon Olympiad is a series of blockchain-based asset management competitions composed of several rounds. Each of the rounds will set a clear goal for participants, and will issue a defined number of Melon tokens.

    Following a successful token sale in 2017, Melonport AG is left with 500,600 Melon (MLN) tokens to distribute. Rather than distribute these in a traditional manner, Melonport has created a series of sub-contribution periods called Melon Olympiad. This will ensure that tokens are allocated to active community members who engage and use the Melon asset management ecosystem.
  </p>
  <p
    className="jsx-__scopedHash"
  >
    The distribution of up to half a million Melon tokens will largely occur via a public contribution period is in keeping with Melonport’s commitment to creating a diverse and decentralized ecosystem in which there are as many participants as possible. By awarding tokens to testers who have put their time and energy into scrutinizing the Melon software, it will also ensure adoption and help to further improve the codebase.
  </p>
  <p
    className="jsx-__scopedHash"

    The contribution period will be split into rounds referred to as Melon Olympiad capsules, with a portion of tokens allocated for each stage. Upon completion of the Melon Olympiad, all 500,600 tokens will have been issued. In keeping with the mythology and provenance of the Olympic Games, each round will be named after a Greek island, commencing with Paros. Participants will be obliged to create a fund and send Ether to the relevant Olympiad smart-contract, which will then be matched with an equivalent amount of MLN tokens plus an additional incentive amount. It is then up to the participant to manage the fund for a period of 2 weeks with a view to maximizing capital appreciation.

    The Melon Protocol intends to present a decentralized, public, permissionless, robust infrastructure for the secure management of digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to be a viable, low-cost alternative to the current fund management ecosystem which has evolved similarly across most legal jurisdictions. The protocol itself is a collection of smart-contracts written in the Solidity programming language. Supporting functionality that allows browsers to freely interact with the protocol is provided by the javascript library Melon.js. For more information visit: https://docs.melonport.com and our github https://github.com/melonproject/.

    In order to contribute ETH to Paros you need to first fund your wallet with the desired amount you want to contribute. In addition, you need to have a bit more ETH in your wallet to cover the gas costs for setting up your fund, register in the competition and (if applicable) to trade.

    Import your wallet either by importing your mnemonic phrase or by uploading your JSON file and decrypting it with your password. You can see your public address on the top right of the page, together with your ETH balance. Your wallet needs to be the whitelisted wallet on Bitcoin Suisse, otherwise you won’t be able to create a fund. In terms of the Melon protocol, this wallet will act as the owner wallet of your fund (manager address), which you will create in a minute.

Below, you will see the estimated amount of MLN tokens that will be invested into your fund by the Paros smart contract (the conversion rate is fixed at 20 MLN tokens for 1 ETH). Make sure that you have enough ETH to cover the gas costs. Once you are ready, please press the “Contribute” button to send ETH to the Paros smart contract.

    From this point onwards, you are free to do what you want. You can see the basic information about your fund in the middle. Your fund is denominated in WETH. There are two options:

    1. 
    <strong

      Keep the MLN tokens
    </strong>
    . In this case, you do not need to do anything until Paros ends (you can see the official end date/time in the top right corner). Once Paros has ended, you will have the option to claim your reward and redeem your shares, which will transfer all MLN tokens of the fund to your wallet address.

    2. 
    <strong
      className="jsx-__scopedHash"

      Trade
    </strong>
    . If you would like to test your fund management skills, you can do so by trading on the decentralized exchanges we have integrated (OasisDex, Radar Relay, ERCDex). As most assets are quoted against ETH, the first trade you need to place is to sell some of your MLN tokens against WETH.
