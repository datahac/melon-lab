        <i>([méllō], μέλλω; Greek for “destined to be”)</i> is blockchain
        software that seeks to enable participants to set up, manage and invest
        in technology regulated investment funds in a way that reduces barriers
        to entry, while minimizing the requirements for trust.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        An Olympiad <i>([əˈlɪmpɪad], Ὀλυμπιάς)</i> is a period of four years
        associated with the Olympic Games of the Ancient Greeks. During the
        Hellenistic period, beginning with Ephorus, it was used as a calendar
        epoch.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          The Melon Olympiad is a series of blockchain-based asset management
          competitions composed of several rounds. Each of the rounds will set a
          clear goal for participants, and will issue a defined number of Melon
          tokens.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Following a successful token sale in 2017, Melonport AG is left with
        500,600 Melon (MLN) tokens to distribute. Rather than distribute these
        in a traditional manner, Melonport has created a series of
        sub-contribution periods called Melon Olympiad. This will ensure that
        tokens are allocated to active community members who engage and use the
        Melon asset management ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        The distribution of up to half a million Melon tokens will largely occur
        via a public contribution period is in keeping with Melonport’s
        commitment to creating a diverse and decentralized ecosystem in which
        there are as many participants as possible. By awarding tokens to
        testers who have put their time and energy into scrutinizing the Melon
        software, it will also ensure adoption and help to further improve the
        codebase.
      </p>
      <p>
        The contribution period will be split into rounds referred to as Melon
        Olympiad capsules, with a portion of tokens allocated for each stage.
        Upon completion of the Melon Olympiad, all 500,600 tokens will have been
        issued. In keeping with the mythology and provenance of the Olympic
        Games, each round will be named after a Greek island, commencing with
        Paros. Participants will be obliged to create a fund and send Ether to
        the relevant Olympiad smart-contract, which will then be matched with an
        equivalent amount of MLN tokens plus an additional incentive amount. It
        is then up to the participant to manage the fund for a period of 2 weeks
        with a view to maximizing capital appreciation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Melon Protocol intends to present a decentralized, public,
        permissionless, robust infrastructure for the secure management of
        digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to be a viable,
        low-cost alternative to the current fund management ecosystem which has
        evolved similarly across most legal jurisdictions. The protocol itself
        is a collection of smart-contracts written in the Solidity programming
        language. Supporting functionality that allows browsers to freely
        interact with the protocol is provided by the javascript library
        Melon.js. For more information visit: https://docs.melonport.com and our
        github https://github.com/melonproject/.

      <p>
        Participants interested in taking part in the Melon Olympiad Paros can
        register by following the instructions provided below.
      </p>
      <h2>Melon Olympiad, first round: Paros</h2>
      <p>
        For the Paros round, the participant compensation is as follows: for
        each ether contributed, the participant will receive 20 MLN (subject to
        change prior to the start of the Paros Olympiad in the event of price
        volatility).
      </p>
      <h2>Instructions on how to participate</h2>
      <p>
        Paros is open to all participants who have undergone the KYC process
        with Bitcoin Suisse and whitelisted their Ethereum addresses generated
        on olympiad.melon.fund.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to ensure the highest level of security and performance, we
        strongly recommend you to download the Electron app and to run your own
        parity node. You can find the instructions{' '}

      <p>
        Before we start, make sure you have either one of the two options ready.
      </p>
      <p>1. Your mnemonic phrase (12 words seed phrase) or</p>
      <p>2. Your JSON file + password</p>
      <p>
        In order to contribute ETH to Paros you need to first fund your wallet
        with the desired amount you want to contribute. In addition, you need to
        have a bit more ETH in your wallet to cover the gas costs for setting up
        your fund, register in the competition and (if applicable) to trade.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 1</h4>
      <p>Press "Setup Fund"</p>
      <h4>Step 2 </h4>
      <p>
        Import your wallet either by importing your mnemonic phrase or by
        uploading your JSON file and decrypting it with your password. You can
        see your public address on the top right of the page, together with your
        ETH balance. Your wallet needs to be the whitelisted wallet on Bitcoin
        Suisse, otherwise you won’t be able to create a fund. In terms of the
        Melon protocol, this wallet will act as the owner wallet of your fund
        (manager address), which you will create in a minute.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 3 </h4>

      </p>
      <h4>Step 4  </h4>{' '}
      <p>Choose a name for your fund and press “Setup fund”.</p>
      <h4>Step 5 </h4>{' '}
      <p>
        You are now at the <strong>contribution page</strong>. Put in the amount
        you want to contribute to the Paros smart contract. Below, you will see
        the estimated amount of MLN tokens that will be invested into your fund
        by the Paros smart contract (the conversion rate is fixed at 20 MLN
        tokens for 1 ETH). Make sure that you have enough ETH to cover the gas
        costs. Once you are ready, please press the “Contribute” button to send
        ETH to the Paros smart contract.{' '}
        <strong>
          The contract, in turn, will invest the equivalent amount in MLN to
          your fund.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <h4>Step 6  </h4>{' '}
      <p>
        Come back to this website olympiad.melon.fund. Once Paros is live, you
        will be guided to create your fund.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 7  </h4>{' '}
      <p>
        Your fund is now deployed to the Ethereum main net and funded with MLN
        tokens. You can see the public address of your fund in the URL.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this point onwards, you are free to do what you want. You can see
        the basic information about your fund in the middle. Your fund is
        denominated in WETH. There are two options:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. <strong>Keep the MLN tokens</strong>. In this case, you do not need
        to do anything until Paros ends (you can see the official end date/time
        in the top right corner). Once Paros has ended, you will have the option
        to claim your reward and redeem your shares, which will transfer all MLN
        tokens of the fund to your wallet address.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>OR</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        2. <strong>Trade</strong>. If you would like to test your fund
        management skills, you can do so by trading on the decentralized
        exchanges we have integrated (OasisDex, Radar Relay, ERCDex). As most
        assets are quoted against ETH, the first trade you need to place is to
        sell some of your MLN tokens against WETH.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terms and conditions must be read by all participants.
